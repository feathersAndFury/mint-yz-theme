# Automated color updates (old backup copy !!!)
This branch is only for improving automated color updates, the new colors themselves are onto another branch. With this auto branch here, building Mint-Y-Colors is now 100% automated. Before, the following parts had to be done by hand and are now automated, just like the rest:  
  * gtk-2.0/menubar-toolbar/  
  * gtk-3.0/thumbnails/  
  * cinnamon/thumbnails/  
  * xfwm4/ (3 colored assets)

### Deleted files
In order to simplify and make things less confusing, these directories and files got deleted:  
  * Mint-Y-Colors/ (The new colors are here on another branch.)  
  * files/usr/share/themes/ (These were all the manual edits and thus are no longer needed.)  
  * src/Mint-Y/variations/ (These are still needed, but they are automatically generated by `update-variations.py` on local HDD or SSD only. Testing different colors was generating thousands of modified files, and github/SebastJava/mint-themes/compare/ was made impossible. So these files will be ignored by `.gitignore`.)  
  * colorize.py (This script got deleted because it only changed hues, not saturation and lightness. It was replaced by manual edits in files/ which in turn got replaced by this auto branch here.)

So now everything is 100% automated, the right way. I am not pretending to be a professional programmer. I just looked at the scripts already existing there in linuxmint/mint-themes, i saw how things were done, and i just carefully duplicated and tweaked some lines, basically. Well, i also added some little new lines of code and some images.

### Required
If you want to build your own theme, you will need to install those packages:  
  * Inkscape, preferably version 1.0 or higher  
  * optipng  
  * imagemagick

### Compatibility issues
There are a few `render-assets.sh` scripts scattered around the `src/Mint-Y` directory and its sub-directories. They contain some `--export-filename` or `--export-png` Inkscape commands. Check that you have the required command for your version of Inkscape, or just replace as required:  
  * Inkscape version 1.0 or higher: `--export-filename`  
  * Inkscape version 0.x: `--export-png`

### Instructions
If you want to create your own theme, here is what to do. Be aware you must have some basic knowledge of the Linux desktop and terminal. There is no warranty, this is at your own risk.
  1. `git clone` this repository. Install the required software and packages listed above.
  2. Edit the colors in `constants.py` and/or any of the src/Mint-Y/ files.
  3. On the first time, you must run ~/mint-themes$ `./update-variations.py All` from your terminal. Later, you can replace `All` with one specific color name like `Blue` for quick testing.
  4. Next, run ~/mint-themes$ `./generate-themes.py` from your terminal.
  5. And finally, copy all the files from ~/mint-themes/usr/share/themes/ into usr/share/themes/
  6. Change your theme in the system preferences.
